# AI Interview Simulator ðŸ¤–ðŸŽ¤

A free, open-source AI interview simulator built with Streamlit. Practice your interview skills without any API keys or costs.

## Important Note

This app uses Hugging Face transformers which require significant resources. If deployment fails due to memory issues, the app will gracefully fall back to simplified analysis without the AI components.

## Features

- **Multiple Question Types**: Behavioral, technical, and general questions
- **Smart Feedback**: Get analysis on your answers with performance scoring
- **Follow-up Questions**: Context-aware follow-up questions
- **Streamlit Deployment**: Ready to deploy on Streamlit Cloud
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Works even if AI models can't load
